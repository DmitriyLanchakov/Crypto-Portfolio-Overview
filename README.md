# Crypto-Portfolio-Overview

Excel File to manage and overview cryptocurrency portfolio. Arsonbunny on Reddit created a template and I tuned it a little bit and tried to make a Step by Step explaination. Hope this helps you.  

<h1>Instructions</h1>

This is a Excel template for creating your own spreadsheet to track your cryptocurrency balances and current prices. Also how much you can see how much you invested and how much profit you made.

1. Download the Excel File

2. open it

3. Delete all the coins you don't have

4. Put the coins you have in

5. Go to http://coinmarketcap.com and select the coin you are interested in.

6. Click the Tools tab and copy paste the link under API Tracker. For example, lets use DASH. The API tracker link can be seen on the tools page and is: https://api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/ticker/dash/

7. Go into the Excel spreadsheet and click the Data tab. Select New Query -> From Other Sources -> From Web, here is a screenshot:https://i.imgur.com/eORxr0P.jpg  Copy paste the API link into the box, click OK.

8. This will load the Query Editor like in this screenshot:https://i.imgur.com/eORxr0P.jpg Simply click on the Record field in the table and it should expand to look like this:https://i.imgur.com/gVldBh1.jpg Click on Convert Into Table on top.

9. This will make a nice table for you to import into a new spreadsheet, you can name it by changing the Name field on the right side.

10. Click save to import and this will make a new sheet with the name entered in the Name field. The data will automatically refresh every time you open the file. You can also manually refresh at any time by clicking Refresh All under the Data tab.

11. Put the Quantity of your coins in.

12. Put the BTC or ETH price you paid for in

13. Go to Book Price and type "=" and select book Price BTC or ETH whatever you paid with. Multiple it with the Value you had on that day. I made an average for the last months under Bitcoin Price and Etherium Price. 
(Note: If anybody knows how to do it with just typing in the date and time that would be great. Until then this is my solution.)

14. Everything else should be done. 

I made this because Binance wasn't showing how much profit I was making in USD.
